## What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. a nice variety of themes to reduce eye strain and fatigue
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

## What do the following commands do?

- pwd - **this is the print working directory. It tells you where you are at**
- ls - **this stands for list. It lists the files and folders in a directory**
- cd - **this stands for change directory. You add the name of directory before cd to enter it.**
- mkdir - **this makes a new directory in the current directory.**
- touch - **this makes a new file in the current direction.**

## Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

- cd projects - **changing directory to projects.**
- mkdir new-project - **this will make a new directory called new-project within the current directory.*
- touch new-project/newfile.md - **this will make a new a new markdown file named newfile under new-project directory.**
- cd .. **it takes you one level up in the directory.**
- ls projects/new-project - **provides the list of the directories and files in new-project.**
