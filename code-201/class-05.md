## Using Images In HTML. Read Common Image Types and Choosing Image Formats

1. What is a real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website?<br>
It gives a written description of the image incase it doesn't load due to poor internet or older browser. It is used by screen readers to describe the image.
2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?<br>
Adding a meaningful description in the `alt` attribute can help people with accessibility needs, help you page be better searched by a search engine, make your website more accessible.
3. Provide an example of when the `figure` element would be useful in an HTML document.<br>
When you need to add organization to your website. For example, by creating an element that housed the image element and a caption tag.
4. Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.<br>
A gif file is great for sending a large number of images to create simple animations, but they tend to be lower quality. Svg images are create for sending quality images for items that need to look sharp.
5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?<br>
I would probably send it as a png as this is a pretty common format that is widely accepted while still being formate that is known for it preseason in reproducing source images.

## Using Color in CSS. Styling HTML Text Elements

1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.<br>
Imagine you take a picture of your parents; this picture will be compared to an element in a website. In this example, your parents are the foreground and the background is, well, the background. In an HTML element, the content is what you want to display and the background is everything that is not covered by the content, thus visible to the user.
2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?<br>
I would start by talking with him seeing what main color he feels represents the vision of his blog. From there, I would go to a design website helps select colors that are in the same palette. Pick a couple of accent colors. The goal is to stick with your palette through our so your website doesn't look so busy.
3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?<br>
Consider the readability. That included considerations to things such as size, style font, color contrast with its background.
4. What do `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` do to HTML text elements?<br>
`font-size` controls the size of the letters by a variety of units, such as `px`, `em`, and `rem`. `font-weight` gives control of the boldness of the text. `font-style` gives control over the italics of the text. 
5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an `h1` element.<br>
You could use the `span` element for each word and mess with it that way (good luck) or you could use the attribute `letter-spacing`.
