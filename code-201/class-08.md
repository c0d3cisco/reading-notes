## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.<br>
It means it acts on a one directional element. A section element will have all of its child elements layed out in a 1 directional manner. From there you can change the direction and layout of the child elements using flexbox.
2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.<br>
When you apply the flexbox display attribute, you have to give assign a flex direction, either row or column. If you select a column direction, the column direction, which is the horizontal direction, will be the main axis and the row direction, which is the vertical direction, will be the cross axis.
3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?<br>
Flexbox has a property that will allow you to reorder the child elements. This can lead to issues with accessibility applications.

## CSS Layout - Flexbox

1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?<br>
Flexbox can be used to have better control to your element. It has more attributes that can be paired with to control the position of the child elements. Also, since this is applied to the parent element and controls the position of the child elements, it allows for more uniform control between the elements. This will save a lot of headache when trying to align your webpage, and it makes it more accessible to all screen resolutions.

2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?<br>
I guess this applies to my long term goal of continues learning. We learned the attribute float before for controlling HTML elements. While it is still useful, we've now learned a more powerful and resilient way to control elements in on a web page. This is one of my favorite parts of learning - learning how to do what you are doing, but better and easier!
