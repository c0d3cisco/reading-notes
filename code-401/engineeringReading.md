# Engineering Readings

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?<br>
The one thing I can think that I uniquely bring is my career (and I think this goes for most) is my experiences. I have a diverse range of life, professional, and educational experiences. I have worked hard throughout my life to ensure what I learn or do (ake my future experiences) are beneficial to the career goals I see myself achieving (which evolve technology and innovation).

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?<br>

> * Ask a google. Ask google but with a little finesse. It can easy to go into a rabbit hole trying to search of an answer if you aren't asking the right questions.
> * Ask a friend/TA. Specially during our time in Code Fellows, but this still applies in the industry. Unless I am the only software engineer in a company (which I think is unlikely), there will be remembers who I can bounce ideas for resolution with.
> * Nap. If I am stuck and getting frustrated, i will make sure to sleep and try again after. There is something about sleeping that calms the brain and allows me to see the problem from a different light.
