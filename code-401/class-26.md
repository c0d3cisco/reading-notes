# Component Based UI

## React Quick Start

1. What are the building blocks of a React app?\
The building blocks of a React app are components.
2. What is the difference between an HTML element and a React component?\
An HTML element is a tag that is used to define the structure of a web page. A React component is a function or class that produces HTML to display content to the screen.
3. What is JSX and why do we use it?\
JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It allows us to write HTML in React. We use it because it allows us to write HTML directly in JavaScript.
4. Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.\
To embed JavaScript expressions in JSX, we use curly braces.
5. Does React or JSX have any special features for iteration or conditional logic?\
Yes, React has special features for iteration and conditional logic. For iteration, we can use the map() function. For conditional logic, we can use the ternary operator.
6. How does React know to respond to a user’s inputs?\
React knows to respond to a user's inputs because it is listening for events.
7. What word indicates that a React component manages data with a Hook?\
The word useState indicates that a React component manages data with a Hook.
8. How can two react components share data?\
Two react components can share data by using props.

## Render and Commit

1. What are the three steps of refreshing a React UI?\
The three steps of refreshing a React UI are:
		1. React updates the DOM
		2. React compares the newly returned element and its children to the previous one
		3. React only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state
2. How do you trigger updates to a component after the initial render?\
You can trigger updates to a component after the initial render by using the useEffect() hook.
3. Does React recreate DOM nodes on every rerender?\
No, React does not recreate DOM nodes on every rerender. It only updates the DOM nodes that have changed.
4. After React has updated the DOM, what still needs to happen before the user sees the change?
The user still needs to see the change. This is done by React comparing the newly returned element and its children to the previous one and only applying the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.

## Additional Questions

1. Note the naming conventions in the Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide. What pattern(s) do you see?\
PascalCase for naming component files and camelCase for their instances.
2. Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?\
I look forward how to use more advance components in React compared to 301.
3. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
I've always struggled with CSS, so I am excited to see what SASS has to offer.
