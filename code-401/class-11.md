# Event Driven Applications

## Event Driven Programming

1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?\
**EventEmitter** module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming.
2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?\
It allows us to create objects that can emit events and listen to events vs objects that have to handle everything themselves.
3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.\
This would be great for setting up mechanisms that result in actions when a user interacts with the browser. At the end of the day, that is what the browser is really for, to interact with the user through user input. Event driven programming listens for those inputs and then does something with them.

## Additional Questions

1. Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?
I look forward learning about the different types of events and how to use them. This is a very important concept for applications in general.
2. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
I want to learn this concept well enough to apply it comfortably to my applications.
