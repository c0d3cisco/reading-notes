1. What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?\
**SQL** as they have more structure and order in table formatted database thus require less to filter to go through more.
2. What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?\
**NoSQL** as their storage/group is determined by the developer and can be more fluid than an SQL database.
3. Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.\
A SQL database is designed to store data that loops like an Excel file, tables with columns and rows. This makes an SQL very good for large amounts of data. NoSQL database on the other hand is for data that doesn't necessary fit in a table nicely, such as graphs, documents, etc.

## [SQL Modeling Techniques](https://www.essentialsql.com/get-ready-to-learn-sql-7-simplified-data-modeling/)

1. Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?\
A one-to-many relationship is the relationship of one item in a table to many other tables. They are related using the primary key and foreign key.
2. Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to **create a whiteboard** of the database tables and their relationships.
3. Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.\
A primary key is the key assigned to the table that is selected, while the foreign key is the keys of other tables. Together they link data that are reflated in different tables.

1. How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?\
Capitalize SQL syntax and lowercase the rest.
2. Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.\
It is process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and improve efficiency.
3. Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.\
The one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many relation is the relationship of data of one table to another. For one-to-one, one data point ties to another data point in another table. A one-to-many is where one data point relates with several data points from another table. A many-to-many is where multiple data points in one table are related to multiple from another, but in order to organize these, a middle table is usually needed as the clarifying link.
