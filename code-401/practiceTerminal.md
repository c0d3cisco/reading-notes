# Practice in the Terminal

As part of the pre-work for Code Fellow's course Code 401, I read over the tutorials on how to navigate (at a high level) the terminal. I knew the majority of the concepts covered, but the tutorials detailed additional features of the terminal that I did not know. Below are some of the features that were new to me or clarified prior understanding.

* Use the backslash to target directories with spaces in their name.
* The `man` command is used to look up the commands available in the system and what they do.
* I knew how to make new and remove directories, but I was never comfortable with moving directories. This tutorial had clear instructions on copying and using that feature to rename files if needed.
