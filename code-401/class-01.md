# Node Ecosystem

## An Introduction to Node.js

1. How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?<br>
A JavaScript Node is a server, which is the computer your computer talks to when you get on a general website. These Node server-computers are able to handle multiple requests at a time, making them very versatile.
2. What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?<br>
Runtime is reference to the 'language' environment code is executed (therefore written) in.
3. What is Node used for?<br>
Node is used to run JavaScript without the browser. This is how JavaScript can be leverages as a server, since a browser is front-end (requires the browser) and servers are back-end (requires no the browser).

## Additional Questions

1. Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?<br>
I look forward learning how to manage the AWS. Looking at job postings, it seems like a good percentage of them mention AWS servers somewhere. They must be very versatile so excited to see what its all about.
2. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?<br>
There is a lot of material to cover, so my goals keep up with the assignments and ask questions quickly (15 min rule) to ensure I don't feel overwhelmed and can keep learning new material as it comes.
