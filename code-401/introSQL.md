# Intro into SQL

SQL Databases are a powerful tool for storing large amounts of data in an organized manner easy for users and programs to filter through the data. It is important the fundamentals for interacting with SQL data bases as searching can be optimized and less work will be have to be performed by any server code that post processes the data. Through a series of of self-guided tutorials, I learned the following:

* How to select data from a table filtered by column and specific conditions.
* How to sort data in ascending or descending order as well as manipulate the number of returned items.
* How to obtain data joined from two tables.
* How to update the data based on a conditional statement. Read to be cautious as it is easy to update unintended fields if the developer is not careful with the conditional statement.
* How to delete the data based on a conditional statement. Use same caution as previous bullet.
* How to create a table from scratch. This tutorial dove into data types.
* How to add and remove columns.
* How to delete a table in its entirety.

Below are screenshots from the tasks in the tutorials.
