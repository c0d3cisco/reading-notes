# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## AWS API Gateway Overview

1. What is Amazon API Gateway?\
Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale. API developers can create APIs that access AWS or other web services, as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud. As an API Gateway API developer, you can create APIs for use in your own client applications. Or you can make your APIs available to third-party app developers.
2. Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless ecosystem?\
Amazon API Gateway is an important part of the Serverless ecosystem because it allows you to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. You can create APIs that access AWS or other web services, as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud. You can also create APIs for use in your own client applications or make your APIs available to third-party app developers.
3. How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?\
API Gateway integrates with other AWS services in the following ways:
- API Gateway can use AWS Lambda functions to execute the logic of a RESTful API backend.
- API Gateway can be used to expose websockets APIs that invoke a Lambda function.
- API Gateway can be used to proxy calls to AWS services.

## AWS API Gateway

1. What are the some benefits of using Amazon API Gateway?\
Some benefits of using Amazon API Gateway are:
- It is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
- It handles all of the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management.
- It has no minimum fees or startup costs.
2. What two API types might you choose from?\
The two API types you might choose from are REST APIs and WebSocket APIs.

## AWS DynamoDB Guide

1. What is DynamoDB?\
DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.
2. Under what circumstances would you recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB?\
I would recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB under the following circumstances:
- If you need a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.
- If you need a database that can scale to handle more than 10 trillion requests per day and support peaks of more than 20 million requests per second.
- If you need a database that can support multiple data models and popular use cases, including relational, key-value, document, and in-memory databases.

## AWS DynamoDB

1. Explain to a non-technical friend how DynamoDB works.\
DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. It is a fully managed database and supports both document and key-value data models. Its flexible data model and reliable performance make it a great fit for mobile, web, gaming, ad tech, IoT, and many other applications.
