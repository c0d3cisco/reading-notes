# Gatsby, next.js, and other JS Frameworks

Frameworks are a collection of libraries that are used to make development easier. Below are some popular JavaScript frameworks.

## [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started)

1. Next.js is a static site generator that uses React and GraphQL to generate static pages from data sources. It offers Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for React based applications in order to improve performance and SEO. This means that your site arrives to the client preloaded which increases speed.

2. Next.js provides improved experiences for API called and routes. Much like loading pages, Next.js pre-renders API routes at build time. This means that the data is already loaded when the client makes the request.

## [Learn Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/)

1. Gatsby.js is a Static Site Generator (SSG) that uses React and GraphQL to generate static pages from data sources. With SSG, the site is generated at build time and the client receives the preloaded site using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. This improves performance and SEO.

2. Gatsby.js hosts a rick ecosystem of plugins that allow you to add functionality to your site. These plugins can be used to add features like image optimization, analytics integration, content management systems (CMS) integration, and more. Gatsby.js allows you to configure and combine plugins to meet your project's specific requirements. The plugin ecosystem makes it easier to enhance your website with various functionalities without having to write custom code from scratch.
