# Growth Mindset

## Why this topic matters

The idea of a 'growth mindset' is that one has to be willing to continue to grow in order to stay mentally resilient. Without the mindset of growth present in an individual, it is likely they may fall into habitual patters and fail to challenge themselves mentally. That individual may grow frustrated at challenging problems rather than staying motivated to find a solution.

I would say the idea of attending Code Fellows in pursuit of a new career in software development is the perfect example of a growth mindset. Being aware that a continuation of self improvement is a necessity for a successful career is crucial, and everyone enrolled in this program is aware of it.
