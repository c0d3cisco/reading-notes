# React Native

## [Getting started with react native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)

1. Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.\
 - `<View>` - A container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls.
 - `<Text>` - Displays, styles, and nests strings of text and even handles touch events.
 - `<Image>` - Displays different types of images.
2. What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?\
It allows you to build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It is called native because it uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps.
3. What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?\
The building blocks of a React Native app are the same as a React app. The difference is that React Native uses native components instead of web components as building blocks.

## Expo

1. What solution does expo provide?\
Expo provides a set of tools and services that help you build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript codebase.
2. Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the **unified** workflow.
3. What is the difference between React Native and Expo?\
React Native is a framework for building native apps using React. Expo is a set of tools, libraries and services which let you build native iOS and Android apps by writing JavaScript.

## Expo snack

1. Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do?\
It is an online editor that allows you to run and share code snippets in the browser, much like CodePen.io.

## Ejecting

1. What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo?\
Ejecting is the process of setting up and using your own custom development environment.
2. When should you not eject?\
If you don't have a need for a custom development environment.
3. Why might you choose to eject?\
If you need to add custom native functionality that is not already included in the Expo SDK.
