## Why this topic matters

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
4. What does a `GET` do?
5. What does a `POST` do?
6. What does `PUT` do?
7. What does `PATCH` do?
