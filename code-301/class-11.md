## nosql vs sql

1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| **SQL** | **NoSQL** |
| ------ | ------ |
| These are Relational Databases | Called non-relational or distributed databases |
| Have a predefined schema<br> Table database | Unstructured dataset. Much more dynamic |
| Scalability is 'vertical' and require more computer power | Scalability is 'horizontal' and require more server connections and storage |
| Good for complex data bases | Good for databases that lack order because of the variety of data |
| These types of databases are easier to manage | Less support and might have to go to forums and smaller communities for support |

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?<br>
SQL is good for organized and complete data bases with similar data sets, usually in a table form.
2. Give a real world example.<br>
Example of include hierarchical database, databases used for file management.
3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?<br>
NoSQL databases are good for databases which house data that is not closely linked. The organization in these databases are best suited for a pool of data that is not hierarchical.
4. Give a real world example.<br>
Graph like data bases. Key-value pair data bases. Connection between items is more lose than SQL.
5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?<br>
SQL
6. Which type of database is best for scalability?<br>
SQL databases are best for scalability as there is more technical support for these data bases. It also requires optimization of query methods or increase in processing power of one database. NoSQL would require increase in size of the database and there is not as much support readily available.

## sql vs nosql

1. What does SQL stand for?<br>
Structured Query Language
2. What is a relational database?<br>
A data bases that works with table where data is related to each other based on certain fields unique to teach database.
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?<br>
It works well with tables. It is really powerful for reorganizing and extracting targeted data.
4. What is a ‘schema’?<br>
The general logical organizational structure of the database.
5. What is a NoSQL database?<br>
Humongous databases. It is a collection of many types of data. These collections are made of multiple documents. This data is very reflexive in data management.
6. How does it work?<br>
It does not have a set schema. It has uses 
7. What is inside of a MongoDB database?<br>
A series to documents. There is no inherent relations in MongoDB, they have to be generated This allows easier manipulation for the relation between the data.
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.<br>
MongoDB because you can set unique query patterns that are specific to the need. Information can be less scattered, but this means that it is likely there is more duplication of the data.
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?<br>
It is harder to scale as well as harder to manage. The data base itself require less structure to be complete, so you might have a database with missing information and it would be hard to identify.
